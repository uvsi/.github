## Hi! We are UVS üëã

Universal Versatile Society (UVS), a UN ECOSOC accredited NGO with consultative status, is launching this eCommerce platform to link local consumers and farmers who offer organic produce and ensure a smooth, seamless delivery process. The purpose of this platform is to meet the customers‚Äô needs for achieving ‚ÄúBetter Production, Better Nutrition, Better Environment, Better Life‚Äù as per the definition of Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)‚Äôs strategic framework to support the Agenda 2030. Through this website, consumers can quickly search the products they want with a much better price and confirm from which providers they can get the above products. Currently, the website is still under refinement for more functionalities such as yield prediction, crop choice and so on.

This eCommerce platform is established by an international team with volunteers from America, Canada, India, Iran, China, and so forth. During the Global AgriInno Challenge 2021 co-hosted by the FAO and Zhejiang University (ZJU), the initiative of this eCommerce platform succeeded in being selected as 1 out of 10 from a pool of 157 teams from 35 countries to pitch into the final round of the competition.
